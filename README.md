# Data-Science-Projects
This repository contains my data science projects, where I utilized tools and libraries such as Spark, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and more, to perform data preprocessing, visualization, and model building.

# Project2
The AI-Powered Job Market Insights project analyzes the impact of AI on employment across various industries using a dataset of 500 unique job listings. The dataset includes job titles, industry, company size, location, AI adoption level, automation risk, required skills, annual salary in USD, remote-friendly status, and job growth projection.  I uesd essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data preprocessing, cleaning, and data analysis. I also build a predictive model for salary prediction using a combination of encoded categorical features and scaled salary data. The model's performance was evaluated using RMSE and visualized using a scatter plot. Further steps include refining the model and exploring additional features to improve prediction accuracy.
# Project1
Project1 The project involved analyzing a Telco customer dataset with 21 features on 7043 customers. The most promising features were identified and machine learning techniques applied, with the Naive Bayes classifier being the most effective. The project taught me the use of Spark for dataset manipulation and user interaction forecasting, with the Naive Bayes model achieving 70.55% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.6741.
