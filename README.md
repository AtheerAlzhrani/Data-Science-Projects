# Data-Science-Projects
This repository contains my data science projects, where I utilized tools and libraries such as Spark, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and more, to perform data preprocessing, visualization, and model building.

# Project2
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the AI-powered job market, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and predictive modeling using a combination of encoded categorical features and scaled salary data. The model's performance was evaluated using RMSE and visualized using a scatter plot. Further steps include finetune the model and exploring additional features to improve prediction accuracy.
# Project1
The project involved analyzing a Telco customer dataset with 21 features on 7043 customers. I used Spark for dataset manipulation and user churn forecasting, with the Naive Bayes model achieving 70.55% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.6741.
