# Data-Science-Projects
This repository contains my data science projects, where I utilized tools and libraries such as Spark, Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and more, to perform data preprocessing, visualization, and model building.

# Project2
The AI-Powered Job Market Insights project analyzes the impact of AI on employment across various industries using a dataset of 500 unique job listings. The dataset includes job titles, industry, company size, location, AI adoption level, automation risk, required skills, annual salary in USD, remote-friendly status, and job growth projection. The project uses essential libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data preprocessing, cleaning, and data analysis. It also creates a predictive model for salary prediction using a combination of encoded categorical features and scaled salary data. The model's performance was evaluated using RMSE and visualized using a scatter plot. Further steps include refining the model and exploring additional features to improve prediction accuracy.
